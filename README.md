# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction

ðŸ“ŒOverview

This project aims to predict whether a patient will suffer from diabetic retinopathy based on blood test features. 
It is a binary classification problem where the target variable (prognosis) has values 0 (no retinopathy) or 1 (retinopathy). 
The dataset consists of 6000 instances and 6 variables.

Dataset Details:
âœ…ID: Numeric identifier
âœ…Age: Numeric feature
âœ…Systolic Blood Pressure: (Normal range: <120mmHg)
âœ…Diastolic Blood Pressure: (Normal range: <80mmHg)
âœ…Cholestrol: (Normal range: 125-200 mg/dl)
âœ…Prognosis: Target variable (0 or 1)

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals 

âœ…Develop a machine learning model to classify patients into diabetic retinopathy risk categories.
âœ…Implement the model using Python and ML frameworks. 
âœ…Deploy the solution using tools like Streamlit for accessibility.

The final model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive visualization.
